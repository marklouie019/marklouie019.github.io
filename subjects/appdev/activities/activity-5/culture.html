                <p>Geisha culture is a timeless symbol of Japanese tradition, known for its elegance and refinement.
                    Geishas
                    are skilled entertainers trained in various traditional Japanese arts, including music, dance, and
                    tea
                    ceremonies. They typically wear elaborate kimonos, white makeup, and distinct hairstyles, embodying
                    grace and poise in every aspect of their appearance and performance. Though they are often
                    associated
                    with beauty, geishas are highly respected for their artistic abilities and serve as cultural
                    ambassadors
                    of Japan's heritage.
                    <br><br>
                    Historically, the geisha world was a mysterious and exclusive society, with rigorous training that
                    began
                    in childhood for those aspiring to join the profession. Today, while fewer in number, geishas
                    continue
                    to preserve their art, mostly in districts like Kyoto’s Gion. They offer a glimpse into Japan's rich
                    past and remain a revered part of the nation's cultural identity.

            <div class="body">
                <p>Kabuki theater is one of Japan’s most iconic forms of traditional performance, known for its stylized
                    drama, vivid costumes, and dramatic makeup. Originating in the early 17th century, kabuki was
                    initially
                    performed by female dancers, but over time, it evolved into an all-male art form, with male actors
                    also
                    taking on female roles. The performances often depict historical events, love stories, and moral
                    conflicts, blending music, dance, and acting to create a dynamic and visually striking experience.
                    <br><br>
                    What sets kabuki apart is its exaggerated movements and the use of elaborate stage mechanisms, such
                    as
                    revolving stages and trapdoors, to enhance the drama. Actors undergo extensive training to master
                    the
                    art’s specific gestures and vocal techniques. Despite its historical roots, kabuki continues to
                    thrive
                    in modern Japan, with performances still attracting large audiences, ensuring its legacy as a
                    cornerstone of Japanese performing arts.

                <p>Anime and manga are two of Japan’s most influential pop culture exports, captivating audiences
                    worldwide.
                    Manga, Japanese graphic novels or comics, covers a wide range of genres and appeals to readers of
                    all
                    ages, from adventure and romance to science fiction and horror. Anime, the animated adaptation of
                    manga
                    or original stories, brings these colorful characters and worlds to life, with visually striking
                    animation and intricate storytelling. Together, they have shaped not just entertainment but have
                    become
                    a cultural phenomenon that continues to grow globally.
                    <br><br>
                    In Japan, anime and manga are more than just entertainment; they are deeply embedded in the
                    country’s modern identity. Popular series like Naruto, Dragon Ball, and One Piece have massive
                    followings, while anime conventions and themed cafes are common. Beyond entertainment, anime and
                    manga often explore deep philosophical, societal, and emotional themes, reflecting Japan’s rich
                    storytelling tradition. Whether you're a casual viewer or a dedicated fan, this culture provides a
                    unique lens into the imagination and creativity of Japan.
